Rough Draft
Standard item/ingredients/sprites pixel art size is 16x16 

List of recipe names, ingredients, descriptions, and properties that enhance the players user experience (XP, Speed Stack, HP, Mana, etc.). The player will only need one of each ingredient to make the recipe. It is possible some of these meals will be made very few times or not at all, it should be possible to play the game without explicitly requiring the player to cook anything. It should give noticeable advantages if they make an effort to cook.

List of ingredients available in the game:
-Fish Items = cod, catfish
-Wild Game = boar, duck, snake, rabbit, deer
-Vegetables/Fruit = Corn, Potatoes, Blue Lime, Apple, Tomato, Sun Dried Garlic, Lettuce
-Crops = Sugar Cane, Wheat, Wild Herbs, Rice
-Misc = Milk, Bread, Honey, Cheese, Eggs, Salt, Sacred Tear (Essence of Mana)

-Cooking Tools = Water, Bowl, Cauldron, Matches, Petrified Wood

(To draw these recipes always start off with a brown bowl sprite, they need to be in a bowl to help have the same sprite size. These meals are consumed immediately after making them and cant be sold/traded. They can be made/consumed in battle in place of health/mana boost potions.)
