MOA(Money): Amount of money Sage has by selling items she's collected, she can use this money to buy ultra expensive upgrades that maybe just buys skins, idk.


Explanation of Sages attributes: 

XP(experience):

Mana(magic power):Mana mostly collected from defeating enemies, eating certain recipies will give some magic 

HP/Hunger(need to eat):The player will have to eat every once in a while, even if the meal does not make her stronger or provide any other enhancements other than just not dying. Not a big deal since there will be enough items to make ingredients without too much trouble.
